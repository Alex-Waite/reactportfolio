                        <p className="card-text">This was a quiz I made when I was still grasping
                            the
                            basics of Javascript, this quiz is special to me because it was
                            around
                            this point in time when i finally felt i understood Javascript.
                            Overall
                            I am satisfied with the simplicity of the code and the lack of bugs
                            clean design.</p>
