                <h6 class="pt-4 bold">Who am I?</h6>
                <p> My name is Alexander Conor Waite, I live in South Australia in the suburb
                    of Unley. I was born and grew up in Mount Barker in the Adelaide Hills </p>
                <h6 class="pt-4 bold">What are your hobbies?</h6>
                <p> In my spare time I like to play video games with my friends, currently my
                    favourite game is
                    Apex Legends. I also enjoy spending time expressing my creativity by designing new
                    outfits or drawing pictures. I am an extroverted person so I like going to social
                    events
                    and find
                    I can have fun doing pretty much anything aslong as I have friends with me.</p>
                <h6 class="pt-4 bold">What do you do?</h6>
                <p> Currently I am doing a coding boot camp at the University of Adelaide. I do not have
                    a
                    job right now
                    however I hope that at the
                    end of this coding boot camp I will have all the skills and employability I need to
                    become a juinior developer for a tech company.</p>
